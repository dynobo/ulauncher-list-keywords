# <img src="images/icon.svg" alt="drawing" width="26"/> Ulauncher List Keywords

`List Keywords` is an extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/). It's kind of a
meta-extension for everyone like me, who can't remember all the keywords to trigger
Ulauncher extensions. It only provides an easy way to query for shortcuts and keywords
of installed extensions, nothing more.

## Demo

## Features

- Type `kw` + `<space>` to list all available keywords and shortcuts.
- Type `kw` + `<space>` + `<query>` to filter the list.
- Select a keyword and hit `<enter>` to immediately use it.
- Some extensions provide more than one keyword. In that case, the extension name is
  shown instead the actual keyword. Select the item and hit `<enter>` to see all
  keywords of that extensions.
- The preferences of `List Keywords` allow you to customize behavior and look.
